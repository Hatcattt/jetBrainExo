Your first task is to create the main window of the program and the field for the game.
Swing has a special class that represents an empty window â€” JFrame.
To improve a basic window, extend this class and write your own window logic.
Here is an example of the code with JFrame:

setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
setTitle("Tic Tac Toe");
setResizable(false);
setSize(450, 450);
setVisible(true);

In addition to the window, create a field with nine cells that represent three rows and three columns.
We can use another class that extends the JButton class for our cells.
For testing purposes, give a name to each of the cells using the setName method.
We will use the algebraic chess notation. Name bottom left cell as ButtonA1 and the top right as ButtonC3.
Also, at the first stage, indicate the coordinates of these cells from A1 to C3.
After starting the program, it should look like an illustration.

To create a field, we can use a separate Board class extending JPanel.
You can use GridLayout (3, 3) as the Layout.
After that, you need to create nine cells and add them to this class.
Add the Board class to the main window with the TicTacToe class.
